        "This is the coursework for the Advanced game Technologies module. The main goal of this coursework is to explore the concept behind physics, AI and networked gaming mechanics.",
        "My Main focus is on the networking part. I spent a week implementing how to move the character and spawn players in server, which I had some difficulty understanding at the beginning as the given material has left out quite a lot. I have to work out quite a lot of missing feature by searching suggestion on the web and adpoting them in c++. Unfortunately, due to time limitation, I could only create the bare minimum multiplayer functionality.",
        "",
        "Other parts that i have made as well:",
        "-Sleeping physics object if the object is stationary for too long.",
        "-Simple Wandering AI which fled when approached.",
        "-Pathfinding AI which Pathfind to player if player is in maze.",
        "",
        "The final result is a simple sandbox that had the capability of 4 simultaneous client connection, with disconnection process included.",
        "",
        "(A skeleton framework is provided as a starting off point where rendering were already completed. The program is written in c++ and used enet for networking) "
