                            Trade is something that is seldom explored in game about war.
                            I guess it boils down to two points, one being that normally trade/logistics are more like chores.
                            You don't want to do them, but you need to. This kind of is the opposite of what we expect of a game to be.
                            Games are suppose to be interesting and other worldly, and not really suppose to be a "job".
                            Another reason might be about empowerment. Games traditionally are designed to empower the player.
                            However, in common media,
                            trade and logistic are usually viewed with a powerless situation and thus might not be considered to be in a major part of the game.

                            That being said, I do think it might be possible.
                            Ship owners during the 1400s are known to have their ship confisated for war,
                            and pirates in the golden age of piracy are usually modified merchant ships which can be converted into pirvateering easily.
                            So the role of a ship's captain/owner does give the player some
