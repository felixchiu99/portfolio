        "I have hosted a modded minecraft experience with my friends on a custom modpack centred around the create mod before, but unreliable connection with my own hosting has ended the last server.",
        "With a job offer in hand, I wanted to start thinking about the next generation of the server hosted by a third party and I wanted to make the experience more interesting. One area of improvement is that the default world gen behaviour of minecraft does not encourage widespread base building, which would be cool using create's amazing railway system.",
        "I have explored ways to tweak the world gen of ores via a custom datapack and added a create inspired deep mining mod to encourage widespead bases in the last iteration of the server but I want to do more this time.",
        "The Idea was to limit tree and crop growth to biomes and causes crops to grow extremely slow if it is not in a suitable biome.",
        "Confirming that this cannot be done via datapack alone, I started experiements with creating my first mod."
